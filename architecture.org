** This file
This is the data definition and architecture expressed in POSTGRESQL
for Bootstrap facilitated training events and participant
tracking. This is a literate file written in Orgmode and tangled using
org-babel.

** Bootstrap
Bootstrap develops curriculum and facilitates training for
professional educators and the organizations that support
them. Bootstrap delivers pedagogical strategies to participant
educators through in-person or virtual learning sessions. Bootstrap
seeks to support teachers from novice learners until they can
confidently implement Bootstrap curriculum in their
classrooms. Bootstrap trainings prepare teachers to deliver the
curriculum such that their students can demonstrate certain skills
evidenced through the curriculum's learning products.

The overarching goal of Bootstrap curricula and trainings is to
support student learning in core academic skills, especially
mathematical reasoning. Teachers are the professionals who deploy
Bootstrap content. The quality of that deployment directly correlates
to student achievement with Bootstrap.  Whether Bootstrap curricula
meets its aim to boost standardized achievement relies on the quality
of a teacher's deployment.

Some of Bootstrap's activities can be accessed by the student
directly. However, the primary market for Bootstrap products and
services is the teacher-student classroom where one teacher will
typically work with a groups of fifteen to thirty students. Bootstrap
teachers must deliver the curriculum. There is no mechanism for
student to work in an entirely self guided environment. Bootstrap
students are typically 10 to 17 years old.

Classrooms vary widely across the United States, and if we consider
international usage, there are many possibilities for the classroom
conditions in which Bootstrap curriculum may be deployed. To capture
some of this variety we look at classroom size, location, subject,
grade level, school schedule model (annual, semeseter, trimester,
block, etc.), student socioeconomic and race/ethnicity demographics,
teacher license and background, admin support, mandate vs teacher
choice, stipend received?, pre post student, pre post teacher,
deployment model (asynchronous, cherry picked, end-to-end, etc.).

Training participants are most often teachers, but are also teacher
assistants and para professionals on the one hand and teacher
supervisors, administrators, and coaches on the other. We track
participant attendance at training events and engagement across our
various systems. We also delineate between participants and observers
who do not interact with classrooms in their daily work, but are
otherwise connected to Bootstrap and may attend training events.

The Bootstrap data model collects data for improving the curriculum,
tracking student academic achievement, and analyzing the relationship
between curriculum, training, and on-going teacher supports and the
experience of teachers in the classroom. We hope to facilitate
analysis and lead to improvements in training and curriculum, which
become measurably better suited to the needs of teachers and student
achievement over time.

Relationships between users and outside organizations are orthogonal
to the relationships between users and Bootstrap. A principal could be
a participant learning Data Science. However, the relationship to the
outside organization affects how the user receives and deploys the
learning and our expectations of them.

** Goals
*** What am I doing?
I am trying to capture the ways Bootstrap is working to grow through a
relational data model.  This model should enable facilitation of
training events, particularly the communication required of
facilitation.  This model should answer key question for the Bootstrap
organization such as whether it is meeting teacher and partner goals
and succeeding in its own growth or how should it grow its trainee
support offerings. This model should hold rolling data for years and
facilitate slicing by year, partner cohort, curriculum, etc.

*** This data model
The primary goal of this data model is to track and analyze the
efficacy of learning supports created by Bootstrap: curriculum
materials and facilitated trainings events.  Bootstrap hopes to
improve the learning model for professional educators, build support
for educators such that they are successful, and works toward
educators feeling confident enough to actually bring a set of
Bootstrap lessons into their classrooms. Bootstrap further measures
success through the achievement of students who received Bootstrap
curriculum. To what extent we can track individual student learning is
on open and complex question.
** Non-goals
It is not a goal at this time to hold curriculum and financial change
records, nor to track contracts facilitators performance, though
information contained here will support a variety of analysis
regarding training efficacy.  Certain aspects of curriculum are
represented here in the assessment model, such as skill groups, lesson
and assessment titles, and curriculum are here and one can imagine
other aspects such as pathway could be stored here as well.  Contracts
(in the business sense) are represented for the purpose of turning on
services (e.g. workbooks, coaching) for client cohorts and for
reporting back to stakeholders.

``Success is when a deliberate change has an intended effect.''

We are successful when students produce learning products with our
curriculum. Student have access to learning activities through
classrooms they are mandated to attend. Teachers facilitate those
classrooms and make choices about what learning happens in the
room. Teachers are supervised and function in a system of standards and
measures. Hence, Bootstrap aims to influence both students and
supervisors (at multiple levels) to bring Bootstrap into more
classrooms.

*** Is our org growing?
**** Are we bringing in more money?
**** Are more teachers using our stuff?
*** Are more students teachers growing and gaining?
**** Are teachers demonstrating growth in skills?
**** Are teachers reporting growth in confidence?
*** Are partner goals being met?
**** Are teachers submitting artifacts?
**** Are students demonstrating growth on pre and post tests?
*** Connect a particular change to growth/usage.

*** TODO Include in Bootstrap overview the essential nature of integrate curriculum
Bootstrap's essential nature invite complexities and constraints. Our
target audience is much more reluctant to change because their courses
are standardized and measured. In effect we have chosen the most
difficult teaching population. This plays directly into our
understanding of the free choice spectrum of our teachers. *see Reporting section*

** Analysis
*** Appropriateness (Fitness) of Training to Participant
- Participant computing background vs implementation
- Participant subject/license vs implementation
- Which facilitation techniques are most effective?
- Which training formats are most appropriate for which participants?
- How do we track the impact of non-teacher participants? Coaches who may be training others, should we attempt to get those names?
- How does years of teaching experience affect implementation after training?
- Which interventions have led to training more teachers to reach more students?
- Which curriculum is most effective at training teachers to implement?
*** Confidence, Implementation, Growth Sentiment Analysis
*** Skills Analysis
*** Students
- How many students are we reaching?
  - How accurate can we get this number?
  - How can we define a range of students reached?
  - Can we define an error within which we know a student is reached?
  - How many students are we reaching per lesson?
*** Correlation Questions
**** Curriculum Change vs Teacher Confidence
Curriculum changes aim to increase efficacy of lesson materials. More teachers would be able to navigate more quickly and more lessons would be delivered to more students.
- Has a given curriculum change increased the efficacy of the lesson materials in a measurable way?
- Training Change vs Confidence
- Facilitator or Event vs Confidence
*** Factors toward implementation
In the United States teachers are the primary driver of what lessons
get taught in their classrooms. However, a wide range of mandates of a
variety of strengths and types are placed upon teachers as they make
curricular decisions.  Teachers using Bootstrap curriculum in their
classroom are influenced by many factors. In some cases teachers are
required to teach certain lessons. In other cases teachers are
choosing to use Bootstrap lessons, who otherwise are not required.
Using Bootstrap can be seen on a teacher-choice spectrum. We seek to
know as much about the motivations behind teachers bringing Bootstrap
into their classrooms as possible.  Other factors affecting teachers
bringing Bootstrap into the classroom include:
- influence of colleagues
- desire to learn or grow themselves
- desire to increase student motivation
- 
**** Compelled Implementation
Teachers may have mandates that compell them to use a certain
curriculum. Mandates placed on teachers vary in strength, how much of
the teacher's work is prescribed and type, which aspects of the
teacher's work are constrained. These mandates include:
- textbook requirements
- online learning platform and gradebook requirements
- technology or computer science requirements (these may include a number of hours or certain standards)
- or, full curriculum mandates
**** Free choice implementation
Some teachers have a great deal of freedom in what or how they teach,
while others have only some freedom of choice.  Certain subject areas
are more prescribed than others.  Standardized testing has a large
impact on teacher freedom even when the teacher is not under a direct
mandate. The phrase "teaching to the test" describes the common
phenomenon of modeling curriculum based on the end of the year
examinations. Curriculum that does not look like the exam is less
likely to be used. This phenomenon is more likely to be found where
student achievement on the exam is not as predictably guaranteed.
** Reporting
Bootstrap partners are in the business of supporting student
learning. Additionally partners may have special interest in a particular
student grouping.

Partners may employ teachers and run schools or they may be an organization or
foundation that is interested in education, technology, equity, or other special
interest that overlaps with Bootstrap products and service

Partners are interested in how well the curriculum supports student
achievement. Bootstrap's niche is supporting student learning in traditional
core subjects such as Algebra.

*** Attendance Reports
- Cohort attendance, sent to cohort admins (unified by contract)
- 
*** Pre Post Diagnostic Results Analysis
- teacher/participant pre/post from trainings
- aggregated classroom pre/post on Bootstrap diagnostics
- pre/post diagnostics from classroom final exam
*** Implementation Reports
*** Standardized Achievement
Are students achieving higher outcomes on standardized exams that they would already be required to take?
Some teachers administer their own diagnostics, and this practice is increasingly more common in administrative mandates.
* Data Model
** Grain
The grain in our data model is the professional educator and the
classrooms they work in. We measure the efficacy of the training
experience as it relates to various factors in the life of a
professional educator. We collect reactions to our trainings and
followup for a period of time as the teacher attempts to bring
Bootstrap curriculum into the classroom. Pre and post test student
data stops at the teacher level. We do not track students as entities
or store any individual student data.

*** Contact
Not an actual table entity. Contact is a notion from Insightly. We
have approximately ten years of "contacts". A contact in this system
is a user who has not been enrolled in an event.
*** Users
One row per person. Anyone who has interacted with Bootstrap, who ever
signed up for an event, even if they did not attend. Anyone who joined
the mailing list through a web form, reached out directly to Bootstrap
staff, messaged through social media, requested answer keys, or joined
Discourse. All facilitators are users and anyone who would be sent an
email is a user.

*** Educator
are often teachers or have had experience in the classroom, but can
also be administrators, paraprofessionals, learning coaches, or
department coordinators. We wish to track the changing role our
professional educators have to their profession and employer. We wish
to know a teachers current schedule and where in that schedule they
have been able to utilize Bootstrap curricula or pedagogy.

Sometimes the participant works alongside teachers and will take the
learning from Bootstrap back to their teachers in their own
professional enrichment setting.
- Principal
- Dean
- Librarian
- Counselor
- Paraprofessional
- Learning Coach
*** Participant
Is enrolled in a training event in order to learning skills and
content. Not facilitating, observing, or supervising.
*** Teacher
has a role within their organization that places them in front of
students for the majority of their day.  Teachers spend the majority
of their professional time interacting with students, and have the
largest and most direct role in affecting student outcomes and the
quality of the Bootstrap implementation.

*** Student
Bootstrap students are 10-17 years old, live primarily in the lower 48
states, and attend school in grades 5-12.

*** Partner
Bootstrap interacts with partners who develop or
support teacher excellence through continued
education or "professional development" for
teachers. Partners include districts, non-profit,
private foundations, corporations, states, and
schools. Individual teachers also join open
enrollment events and may be paying out of pocket.

*** Contract
*** Stipend
Teachers often receive some form of compensation
from their school, district, or supporting
organization.

*** Administrator
Administrators have a role to their organization that places them
supporting teachers for the majority of their day. They are sometimes
the point persons on the contracts (cohort admin), who create training
events and build cohorts. More often teachers are beholden to
administrators who are not directly connected to Bootstrap, but who
may have a large role in the teacher's implementation.

*** Implementation
describes a teacher using Bootstrap curriculum with
their students. Bootstrap curriculum is designed to fit in as a module
into existing classes with established goals. Teachers using Bootstrap
in their classes have identified a learning goal or series of goals
that Bootstrap curriculum covers. Depending on the course objectives
and grade band of students different swaths of curriculum are
available. Implementation is a description of the context in which a
teacher is using Boostrap, to what depth and what breadth.

*** Student achievement
measures show gains through
pre and post diagnostics of skills covered by the
Bootstrap curriculum. These skills overlap between
Bootstrap curriculum, but have different contexts
that they support. Student learning requires both
high quality curriculum and high quality
deployment by the teacher.

*** Curriculum End User
The end users of Bootstrap curriculum are students, who will be using tools like
the Pyret or CODAP to build projects.

*** Participant Life Cycle
- Intake
- Onboarding
- Training
- Implementation with Support
- Solo Implementation
- Repeated training
- Second curriculum
- Master Teacher in Training
- Master Teacher

*** Training End User
The end users of Bootsrap trainings are
teachers. In most cases the person in the chair is
a teacher, who will bring the training, pedagogy,
and curriculum back to students in their
classroom.

*** Year Cohort
*** Partner Cohort
*** Curriculum Cohort
*** State Cohort
A partner cohort is a group of teachers supported by a particular
contract. Cohorts begin with a training event and end at a certain date. 

*** Cohort Admin
Within a Bootstrap contract the point persons for the partner
organization are the admins of the contracted event. Admins receive
reporting and communication about their cohort. Cohort admins track teacher
attendance at training events and may disperse stipends to teachers
based on deliverables.

*** Master Teacher in Training
Has been in trainings for several years and demonstrated proficiency across the concept map

*** Master Teacher
Can co-lead a professional development, run coaching sessions, and moderate on the question forum.

*** Facilitator
Training events are facilitated by Bootstrap Master Teachers who have
been trained to facilitate events. Typically Master Teachers co-lead
for a period of time before they facilitate events by themselves. A
facilitator is the primary point person for training participants
during and immediately after the training event.

*** Coach
A coach is a Bootstrap Master teacher supporting groups of teachers
through short regular sessions. These sessions are largely driven by
the questions and needs of teachers in the process of using Bootstrap
curriculum in their classrooms.

*** Professional Development
A training event that covers an entire curriculum is considered
professional development. Participants in professional development
events are trained as both student and teacher. They must understand
the curriculum and the pedagogy behind key point in the curriculum.
*** Partner Reports
Partners often request reports, especially
attendance, which they use to track participant
participation and to validate stipends. The
partner may or may not have requirements for the
form of the report.

Reports for partners include
- a teacher level attendance report
- a teacher level proficiency report
- implementation reports
- cohort aggregations
*** Internal Reports
- Interventions over time
- Teacher retention
- Types of facilitation experience vs implementation

the curriculum in which you were trained in the
same calendar year.
